# Legend has it ...
Long ago, in the before times (about 2019), a young Mage skilled in the craft of Pressing Words became aware of others looking to embark on the journey of learning this powerful magicks.  He sought to create an aide, a guide for beginners taking their first steps on the path to their development.  This guide became known as "Project Zero" and would grow and evolve to respect and hold true two of the Prime Dieties: Sehanine, the Moonweaver; and Avandra, the Changebringer.

## New name, who dis?
What started as a quick beginner theme for me to spin up for a client project has now become a standalone project to help other WordPress developers to create themes quickly.  Project Zero now comprises of a theme and a plugin which can work together and utilise a number of WordPress best practices.  It is from the most recent build of the theme that the plugin was spawned.

The theme goes under the name of "Sehanine", after the Moonweaver deity from Dungeons and Dragons.  She has been used in the liveplay stream Critical Role and is the Goddess of illusion and misdirection, appearing in a number of forms as fits her purpose.  She's probably the best deity to name a theme after, since the purpose of a theme is to create a new image for your site as you see fit.  The plugin is named after "Avandra", the Goddess of freedom, travel, adventure, and luck.  Adding plugins does come fraught with issues, but the whole system is built on the premise of freedom, and plugins are one of the best mechanisms to exercise that freedom to build your own site.

You can fork both of these projects as you wish and use them to build your own site.  Some planned elements have been moved to the plugin for best practices, and both are free to fork and develop as your own projects.  They are released under the [GNU General Public License version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which should be maintained for your own projects.  This makes the plugin compatible with WordPress, which was released under the [GNU General Public License version 2 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

"Sehanine" has been built to work best with WordPress 6.0 and above, but most of the features can be used in lower versions.  It is recommended that you use the latest version of WordPress for your site for security purposes, and every measure has been taken to prevent as many conflicts as possible.

Since this theme is a standalone project to help you become a developer, it comes without direct support.  However, there are plenty of resources available, should you need them, and continually developing documentation is available at [nathanhawkes.co.uk/project-zero/](https://www.nathanhawkes.co.uk/project-zero/).  You can also use the [WordPress Codex]([https://](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/)) to find out more information about the functions in the theme.
