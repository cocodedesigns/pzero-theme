  Theme Name: Sehanine (Project Zero Theme)
  Theme URI: https://githib.com/{USER NAME}/{REPO-NAME}/
  Description: A blank theme developed for budding WordPress theme developers. You can use this as a starting point for all of your theme development. The theme goes under the name of "Sehanine", after the Moonweaver deity from Dungeons and Dragons.  She has been used in the liveplay stream Critical Role and is the Goddess of illusion and misdirection, appearing in a number of forms as fits her purpose.  She's probably the best deity to name a theme after, since the purpose of a theme is to create a new image as you see fit.
